# PUBG_AHK
A set of autohotkey scripts that I made/use for PUBG.  
Autofire and disable mouse wheel are developed myself and mute current application is forked from [kristoffer-tvera/mute-current-application](https://github.com/kristoffer-tvera/mute-current-application).

# Autofire:
The autofire script will ONLY work in PlayerUnkown's Battlegrounds and ONLY while the mouse cursor is not visible.
This means that the auto fire can only go off while you are in game and not in a menu, this allows you to keep Autofire on and continue to manage you inventory.  
Make sure to use the auto fire that is for your monitor resolution, currently supported are 1080p and 1440p, you can request a different one if you need it.  
Autofire also Disables the mouse wheel while in game.  
Fire rate is randomized between 14ms and 25ms with the randomized value subtracted by 5ms.  
Displays Autofire on tooltip when zooming in, if it is on.  
Compensation is currently disabled.  

Autofire Keybinds:
Fire - Left Mouse Button, when enabled  
Toggle Autofire on and off - "B"  
Enable Autofire - Numpad 1/Numpad End  
Disable Autofire - Numpad 0/Numpad Insert  

# Crouch Jump
All jumps made with the default keybindings will be crouch jumps, allowing the player to jump over and on top of things otherwise impossible.

# Disable Mouse Wheel:  
Simply disables the mouse wheel from being used in PUBG.  
You can still use the mouse wheel in the menus just not to change weapons.  
 
# Mute Current Application:  
A script that can be used on anything it mutes and unmutes the current application you are in when you press F1.
