Warning: I am not responsible for anything that happens to your computer, software, and/or accounts if you use this autohotkey script. I do use it myself, it uses random click times and should be safe.

Autofire:
Auto fire is named disable mouse wheel(resolution) for right now just to be safe, even though it is just a complex macro when it comes down to it.
The autofire script will ONLY work in PlayerUnkown's Battlegrounds and ONLY while the mouse cursor is not visible.
This means that the auto fire can only go off while you are in game and not in a menu.
This allows you to keep Autofire on and continue to manage you inventory.
Make sure to use the auto fire that is for your monitor resolution currently supported are 1080p and 1440p, you can request a different one if you need it.
Disables the mouse wheel while in game.
Fire rate is randomized between 14ms and 25ms with the randomized value subtracted by 5ms.

Compensation is currently disabled.

Autofire Keybinds:
